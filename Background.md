# The rising epidemic of vaping in North America: Health Impacts, Comparison to cigarettes, long-term effects, and its impact on youth.

## Problem Context
Although tobacco use has been around for centuries, vaping has only started its rise within the last ten to fifteen years. Yes, cigarettes are bad and include many chemicals and toxins that are not good for human health, but vaping is much worse. This is stated because there is way less research conducted on the effects of vaping in comparison to the effects of smoking, about how they affect health problems such as collapsed lungs and cancer, as well as other serious long-term effects. To that, Canada health even stated, *“It is difficult to assess the exact impacts of vaping on human health. This is because the quantities and number of chemicals from vaped aerosol, which users are exposed to, depend on the type of device, temperature setting, vaping liquid ingredients and quality, and individual vaping patterns.”* [[1]](#1). Electronic cigarettes also contain many chemicals that consumers do not know about, or the companies are not transparent about. 

They are specifically designed to be addictive, as not only do they provide nicotine, which is an addictive substance, but are also odourless, rechargeable, and physically designed to look nice or attractive to the eye, especially to a younger audience. The CDC also backs these claims up as they have said, *“E-cigarette marketing and advertising, the availability of appealing flavours, social influences, and the effects of nicotine all play a role in why youth start and/or continue to vape.”* [[2]](#2). These factors allow for more people to turn towards vaping either for the first time, or instead of cigarettes, as they are easy to use, basically undetectable, and not as looked down upon in society compared to smoking. The issue is young and old, will pick up this new habit without understanding the consequences and long-term effects.

## Significance of Study
The research and importance of conversation on this issue is crucial because not only is it an unhealthy substance people are consuming at a mass rate, but it is also severely impacting the younger generation and needs to be addressed. Some main significant points are:

1.	The majority of vapes contain highly addictive chemicals as well as harmful chemicals that could even cause cancer or tiny particles that can go deep into the lungs. They also may contain other harmful ingredients like nickel, tin, and lead, as well as flavouring chemicals that have been linked to lung cancer. [[3]](#3)

2.	It is stated that, of course, cigarettes are very dangerous as well, containing a mix of 7,000 different harmful chemicals, the issue is that vaping has also been used for smokers to transition to quit, having the feeling that they are “better” or “safer” [[3]](#3). With this, the lack of research and cases available to refer to on the long-term health effects of vaping and how much harm it could cause compared to the amount of research done on the effects of smoking is a large difference. It is difficult as cigarettes have been around for a lot longer compared to e-cigarettes, so there is a lot less data to go off of. 


3.	A huge concern is protecting the youth and making sure they grow happy and healthy. Although it has been mentioned that there is a lack of data and research on how vaping affects human health, there is a lot more on nicotine in general. With this in mind, there is a large amount of data on how nicotine impacts youth. It is dangerous first of all because from the age of 0-25, human brains are still developing, and consuming harmful chemicals like nicotine can harm their brain development. [[3]](#3). 

4.	Also, on the topic of youth, they are very prone to addiction in general, and with nicotine addiction, it can happen very quickly and evolve rapidly and turn into daily use. Youth vaping could also increase risk or be a gateway into smoking cigarettes, as well as cause further addiction issues developing into other substances such as drugs. To that, nicotine can also, “harm the parts of the brain that control attention, learning, mood, and impulse control.” [[3]](#3)

## Research Objectives
### In this study I am aiming to:

1.	Compare the impact between cigarettes and vaping have considering usage and health
2.	Analyze the data on how youth vaping has impacted their health
3.	Compare the data between youth in general and students vaping to see if demographics such as age and education have any impact
4.	Identify the main topics that have come from youth vaping, such as beliefs, what lead them to vape, and mental health
5.	Compare usage and impact between youths and adults

## Datasets

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (2023).  *About historical NYTS data and documentation*. CDC. https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/about-data/surveys/historical-nyts-data-and-documentation.html 

### Explanation of Dataset
The NYTS survey has collected data and surveys on topics such as, *“tobacco use, demographics, youth access to tobacco and exposure to secondhand smoke.”* [[4]](#4). In these data sets they also include, *“national data about middle school and high school student’s beliefs, attitudes, behaviours, and exposure to tobacco influences.”* [[4]](#4). These datasets are valuable because they not only cover tobacco use in general and the demographics but also a ton of information on how vaping affects youth and how youth perceive vaping, which directly correlates with the main problem at hand.

Government of Canada. (2023, Sept, 19). *Canadian Tobacco and Nicotine Survey (CTNS). Health Canada*. https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/canadian-tobacco-nicotine-survey.html

### Explanation of Dataset
The CTNS survey, which used to be known as the Canadian Tobacco, Alcohol, and Drugs Survey (CTADS), split into the CTNS and the CADS Survey in 2019. The CTNS survey covers the years 2019 through 2022. These surveys *“measure the prevalence of cigarette smoking, vaping, cannabis, and alcohol use among Canadians aged 15 years and older.”* [[5]](#5). The surveys were conducted by Statistics Canada. This survey covers topics like nicotine, tobacco, and vaping, which is important because it helps the government have an understanding and be able to develop and implement strategies, policies and programs that could better aid with these issues [[5]](#5).

### Explanation of Dataset
The Canadian Student Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey (CSTADS) was previously named the Youth Smoking Survey (YSS). The CSTADS survey covers the years 2014 through 2022. These surveys collect data from students in grades 7 to 12. The newest survey (2021-2022) included new questions on self-reported physical and mental health [[6]](#6). These surveys are important because they not only cover data on youth but specifically students and students from different schools, which provides more specific demographics to look at and analyze.
