# Vaping in North America Analysis Project

*By: Abby Jameson*

## Executive Summary
This study analyzes the issue of vaping in Canada and how it is used by students within the country. The analysis is based on the dataset provided by the Government of Canada. The goal is to find patterns and trends within these topics, compare and contrast data, and give an understanding of if and how vaping is such a large and up-and-coming issue with students. Through analysis and visualizations, as well as meeting the goal for this project, it will give insight into the importance of knowing and understanding this issue.

## Key Performance Indicators

<!-- consider adding a value statement rather than how you would use it (e.g the bullets you have now are technical and not needed once you complete the visuals.. instead it is better to highlight "SO WHAT" types of information - it shows more sophistication and long term planning ).  E.g. understanding student vaping prevalence rate helps inform policy regarding risk mitigation, etc...-->

### 1.	Student Vaping Prevalence Rate

Measured through Canadian Student Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey (CSTADS) data for grades 7-12, this KPI tracks the percentage of students who report vaping usage. This can be segmented by grade level and compared by reasons for currently vaping and continuing to vape, and where they acquire vapes to understand if any data stands out or is important to note.

### 2.	Rate of future usage perception through the gender demographic
   
Measured through CSTADS data for gender (*Male, Female, Unspecified*), this KPI tracks the percentage of if the students will vape within the next year. This allows for comparison between gender to see if there is a difference.


### 3.	Geographic Usage Patterns

Measured through CTSADS data for Provinces, this KPI measures the amount of students within each province on why they vape or will not be vaping in future. This allows for comparison of provinces to visualize any differences.


### 4.	Flavor prevalence

Using CTSADS data on flavors, this KPI can track favored flavors and flavor importance with students. It can be segmented by flavor, and visualized to understand if students favor flavors, considering Canada's ban on flavored vapes.


### 5.	Rural and Urban usage rates

Using CSTADS data, this KPI tracks the percentage of students within rural and urban areas. It can be segmented by intentions on whether students will vape in the next year to visualize any comparison between the two.
