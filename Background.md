# The rising epidemic of vaping in North America: Health Impacts, Comparison to cigarettes, long-term effects, and its impact on youth.

## Problem Context
Although tobacco use has been around for centuries, vaping has only started its rise within the last ten to fifteen years. Yes, cigarettes are bad and include many chemicals and toxins that are not good for human health, but vaping is much worse. This is stated because there is way less research conducted on the effects of vaping in comparison to the effects of smoking, about how they affect health problems such as collapsed lungs and cancer, as well as other serious long-term effects. To that, Canada health even stated, *“It is difficult to assess the exact impacts of vaping on human health. This is because the quantities and number of chemicals from vaped aerosol, which users are exposed to, depend on the type of device, temperature setting, vaping liquid ingredients and quality, and individual vaping patterns.”* [[1]](#1). Electronic cigarettes also contain many chemicals that consumers do not know about, or the companies are not transparent about.
