# Vaping in North America Analysis Project

*By: Abby Jameson*

## Executive Summary
This study analyzes the issue of vaping in North America and how it affects health, comparing e-cigarettes to cigarettes, its long-term effects, and its impact on youth. The analysis is based on datasets provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Government of Canada. The goal is to find patterns and trends within these topics, compare and contrast data, and give an understanding of why vaping is such a large and up-and-coming issue. Through analysis and visualizations, as well as meeting the goal for this project, it will give insight into the importance of knowing and understanding this issue.

## Key Performance Indicators

<!-- consider adding a value statement rather than how you would use it (e.g the bullets you have now are technical and not needed once you complete the visuals.. instead it is better to highlight "SO WHAT" types of information - it shows more sophistication and long term planning ).  E.g. understanding student vaping prevalence rate helps inform policy regarding risk mitigation, etc...-->

### 1.	Student Vaping Prevalence Rate

* Measured through Canadian Student Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey (CSTADS) data for grades 7-12
* Tracks percentage of students who report vaping 
* Can be segmented by grade level and compared year over year (2014-2022)

### 2.	Youth Risk Perception Index
   
* Using Canadian Tobacco and Nicotine Survey (NYTS) data on beliefs and attitudes
* Measures how students perceive the health risks of vaping
* Tracks changes in risk perception over time
* Can be compared with actual usage rates

### 3.	Demographic Usage Patterns

* Using Canadian Tobacco and Nicotine Survey (CTNS) data for ages 15 and older
* Measures prevalence rates across different age groups
* Allows comparison between youth (15-24) and adult usage patterns

### 4.	Vaping vs Cigarette Usage Rate
* Using CSTADS data to track the correlation between vaping and smoking and compare
* Measures relationship between cigarettes and vaping among students
* Can be segmented by age

### 5.	Health Impact Indicator
* Using CSTADS 2021-2022 data on self-reported physical health
* Tracks correlation between vaping frequency and reported health issues
* Can be broken down by: Physical health complaints, Energy levels, Sleep patterns, General wellbeing scores
